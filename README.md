# Height-Weight Linear Regression

This project demonstrates a simple **Linear Regression** model to predict **Weight** based on **Height** using a sample dataset.

## Files
- `linear_regression_app.py`: Streamlit app for running the model and visualizing results.
- `data/height_weight.csv`: Dataset containing `Height` and `Weight` values.

## Requirements
Make sure to install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
